## Install

You may need to `Package Control: Satisfy Libraries` to install dependencies.  

More info about 3rd party dependencies, see [SO link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61196270/how-to-properly-use-3rd-party-dependencies-with-sublime-text-plugins).  

Plugin use [`ruamel-yaml`](https://packagecontrol.github.io) dependency.  

Plugin dependencies in [`dependencies.json`](https://github.com/53v3n3d4/Zukan-Icon-Theme/blob/main/dependencies.json).  

## `.python-version`

Change ST python interpreter in `.python-version` file: 3.3 or 3.8.  

## Themes

To make an icon show on ST, a sublime-theme is created in `icons` folder.  

Plugin use two templates. One with, and another without, attributes for hover and selected effet.  

## Syntaxes

Aside icons PNGs, tmPreferences and theme file, there are cases where the plugin use a sublime-syntax to show icons:  
- Show icons for a file extension, without syntax package installed  
- An icon for a library/package/application file. Example: tsconfig.json (json file)  
- An icon for a specific file. Example: a README.md (markdown file)  

## Notes
- This package uses tmPreferences and sublime-syntax files, it is heavily based on how [`A File Icon`](https://github.com/SublimeText/AFileIcon) package make icons work
